# 
# Track record of database updates.
#
# Each key (1000, 1001, ...) in this properties file is supposed to have a matching file,
# called key.sql (1000.sql, 1001.sql, ...).
#
# The database is said to be version 1000 if 1000.sql has been loaded etc.
# The database keeps track of loaded versions in table util.musiccabinet_version.
#
# If a file (say 1500.sql) is defined in this file, and it has a greater number than
# the largest version loaded to the database so far, the instructions in 1500.sql
# can be loaded by invoking loadNewDatabasUpdates() in DatabaseAdministrationService.
#
# This allows us to distribute new bundled release files with new database features,
# to clients with a previous installation of MusicCabinet. Rather than forcing clients
# to re-install their database, it can silently be upgraded to latest schema version.
#
